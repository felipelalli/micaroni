To create alternative bitmap drawables for different densities,
you should follow the 3:4:6:8 scaling ratio between the four generalized
densities. For example, if you have a bitmap drawable that's 48x48 pixels
for medium-density screen (the size for a launcher icon), all the different
sizes should be:

36x36 for low-density          (.75)
48x48 for medium-density       (1)
72x72 for high-density         (1.5)
96x96 for extra high-density   (2)
