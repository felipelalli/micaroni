The algorithm must be deterministic, i. e., predictable,
with the same result if executed multiple times with the same input.
If you use random calculation, you should use a single seed, called
"lucky number" which is the genotype of the Tamagotchi. Do not use
any external data during execution. Codes do not deterministic can
cause sudden death.
