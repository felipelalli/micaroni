    <string name="description">It erases all the Wi-Fi
            configurations in your Android system.
            It is useful when you have a long list of
            remembered Wi-Fi and wants to erase ALL. The Android native
            system (at least so far 2.3.3) does not have a way to erase ALL,
            you must to erase one by one, what is really sucks.</string>
