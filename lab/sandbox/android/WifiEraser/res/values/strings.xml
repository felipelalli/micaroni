            configurations in your Android system.
            It is useful when you have a long list of
            remembered Wi-Fi and wants to erase ALL. The Android native
            system (at least so far 2.3.3) does not have an easy way to erase
            ALL. You must to erase one by one, and this is really sucks.</string>
