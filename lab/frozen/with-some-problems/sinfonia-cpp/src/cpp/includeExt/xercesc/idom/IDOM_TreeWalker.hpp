/**
 * <code>IDOM_TreeWalker</code> objects are used to navigate a document tree or
 * subtree using the view of the document defined by its <code>whatToShow</code>
 * flags and any filters that are defined for the <code>IDOM_TreeWalker</code>. Any
 * function which performs navigation using a <code>IDOM_TreeWalker</code> will
 * automatically support any view defined by a <code>IDOM_TreeWalker</code>.
 *
 * Omitting nodes from the logical view of a subtree can result in a structure that is
 * substantially different from the same subtree in the complete, unfiltered document. Nodes
 * that are siblings in the IDOM_TreeWalker view may be children of different, widely separated
 * nodes in the original view. For instance, consider a Filter that skips all nodes except for
 * Text nodes and the root node of a document. In the logical view that results, all text
 * nodes will be siblings and appear as direct children of the root node, no matter how
 * deeply nested the structure of the original document.
