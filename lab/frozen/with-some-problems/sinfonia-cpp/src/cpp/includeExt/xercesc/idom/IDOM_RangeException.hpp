  * Encapsulate range related DOM error or warning. DOM level 2 implementation.

  * <p> The DOM will create and throw an instance of IDOM_RangeException
  * when an error condition in range is detected.  Exceptions can occur
  * when an application directly manipulates the range elements in DOM document
  * tree that is produced by the parser.
  *
  * <p>Unlike the other classes in the C++ DOM API, IDOM_RangeException
  * is NOT a reference to an underlying implementation class, and
  * does not provide automatic memory management.  Code that catches
  * a DOM Range exception is responsible for deleting it, or otherwise
  * arranging for its disposal.
