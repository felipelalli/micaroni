 * This interface represents an entity, either parsed or unparsed, in an XML

 *

 * declaration. <code>Entity</code> declaration modeling has been left for a
 * later Level of the DOM specification.
 * <p>The <code>nodeName</code> attribute that is inherited from
 * <code>Node</code> contains the name of the entity.
 * <p>An XML processor may choose to completely expand entities before  the
 * structure model is passed to the DOM; in this case there will be no
 * <code>EntityReference</code> nodes in the document tree.
 *
 * <p>Note: the first release of this parser does not create entity
 *    nodes when reading an XML document.  Entities may be
 *    programatically created using DOM_Document::createEntity().
