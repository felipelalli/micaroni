//  This file is part of the internal implementation of the C++ XML DOM.
//  It should NOT be included or used directly by application programs.
//
//  Applications should include the file <dom/DOM.hpp> for the entire
//  DOM API, or DOM_*.hpp for individual DOM classes, where the class
//  name is substituded for the *.
//


//
//  Define inline casting functions to convert from
//    (IDOM_Node *) to IDParentNode or IDChildNode *.
//
//  This requires knowledge of the structure of the fields of
//   for all node types.  There are three categories -
//
//  Nodetypes that can have children and can be a child themselves.
//    e.g.  Elements
//
//       Object
//           IDNodeImpl     fNode;
//           IDParentNode   fParent;
//           IDChildNode    fChild;
//             ...            // other fields, depending on node type.
//
//  Nodetypes that can not have children, e.g. TEXT
//
//       Object
//           IDNodeImpl     fNode;
//           IDChildNode    fChild;
//              ...            // other fields, depending on node type
//
//  Nodetypes that can not be a child of other nodes, but that can
//  have children (are a parent)  e.g. ATTR
//       Object
//           IDNodeImpl     fNode;
//           IDParentNode   fParent
//               ...           // other fields, depending on node type
//
//   The casting functions make these assumptions:
//      1.  The cast is possible.  Using code will not attempt to
//          cast to something that does not exist, such as the child
//          part of an ATTR
//
//      2.  The nodes belong to this implementation.
//
//    Some of the casts use the LEAFNODE flag in the common fNode part to
//    determine whether an fParent field exists, and thus the
//    position of the fChild part within the node.
//
//  These functions also cast off const.  It was either do that, or make
//  a second overloaded set that took and returned const arguements.
