/**
 * Filters are objects that know how to "filter out" nodes. If a
 * <code>IDOM_NodeIterator</code> or <code>IDOM_TreeWalker</code> is given a
 * filter, it applies the filter before it returns the next node.
 *
 * If the filter says to accept the node, the iterator returns it; otherwise, the
 * iterator looks for the next node and pretends that the node that was rejected
 * was not there.
 *
 *  The DOM does not provide any filters. Filter is just an interface that users can
 *  implement to provide their own filters.
 *
 *  Filters do not need to know how to iterate, nor do they need to know anything
 *  about the data structure that is being iterated. This makes it very easy to write
 *  filters, since the only thing they have to know how to do is evaluate a single node.
 *  One filter may be used with a number of different kinds of iterators, encouraging
 *  code reuse.
