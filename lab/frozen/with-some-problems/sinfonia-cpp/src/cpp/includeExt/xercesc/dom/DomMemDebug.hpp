// This class aids in debugging memory management problems with the
//  reference counted DOM classes - DOMStrings, Nodes (including subclasses),
//  and NamedNodeMaps.
//
// Usage Example:
//      DomMemDebug  initialState;   // Captures allocation totals
//          ...                     //    Test code performs DOM
//          ...                     //    operations here.
//
//      DomMemDebug  exitState;     //   Captures post-test state.
//      ExitState.printDifference(initialState);  // Display leaks.
