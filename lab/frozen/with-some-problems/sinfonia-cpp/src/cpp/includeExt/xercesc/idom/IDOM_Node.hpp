/**
 * The <code>Node</code> interface is the primary datatype for the entire
 * Document Object Model.
 *
 * It represents a single node in the document tree.
 * While all objects implementing the <code>Node</code> interface expose
 * methods for dealing with children, not all objects implementing the
 * <code>Node</code> interface may have children. For example,
 * <code>Text</code> nodes may not have children, and adding children to such
 * nodes results in a <code>DOMException</code> being raised.
 * <p>The attributes <code>nodeName</code>, <code>nodeValue</code>  and
 * <code>attributes</code> are  included as a mechanism to get at node
 * information without  casting down to the specific derived interface. In
 * cases where  there is no obvious mapping of these attributes for a specific
 *  <code>nodeType</code> (e.g., <code>nodeValue</code> for an Element  or
 * <code>attributes</code>  for a Comment), this returns <code>null</code>.
 * Note that the  specialized interfaces may contain additional and more
 * convenient mechanisms to get and set the relevant information.
