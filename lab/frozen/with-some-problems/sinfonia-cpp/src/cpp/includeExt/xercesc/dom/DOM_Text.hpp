/**
 * The <code>Text</code> interface represents the textual content (termed
 * character  data in XML) of an <code>Element</code> or <code>Attr</code>.
 * If there is no markup inside an element's content, the text is contained
 * in a single object implementing the <code>Text</code> interface that is
 * the only child of the element. If there is markup, it is parsed into a
 * list of elements and <code>Text</code> nodes that form the list of
 * children of the element.
 * <p>When a document is first made available via the DOM, there is  only one
 * <code>Text</code> node for each block of text. Users may create  adjacent
 * <code>Text</code> nodes that represent the  contents of a given element
 * without any intervening markup, but should be aware that there is no way
 * to represent the separations between these nodes in XML, so they
 * will not (in general) persist between DOM editing sessions. The
 * <code>normalize()</code> method on <code>Element</code> merges any such
 * adjacent <code>Text</code> objects into a single node for each block of
 * text; this is  recommended before employing operations that depend on a
 * particular document structure, such as navigation with
