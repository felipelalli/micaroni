If you come here expecting some puzzle game... I'm sorry to have disapointed you!

My puzzle is:

When I am starting to put some idea on computer...

- what language should I choose?
- what implementation should I choose?
- how should I organize my sources?
- and what about my building scripts?
- should I just write my idea on LaTeX?
- should I use any system database?
- could have my programs dependences of big (and monsters) externals implementations?
- what the best way to integrate nice solutions written in different languages?

If somebody can help me, please answer here:

It's a kind of philosophies questions, so I don't expect
you talk too specific things.

Thank you!!
